      <h3> <b> Reflect on something that someone has done for you that has made you happy or thankful in a surprising way. How has this gratitude affected or motivated you?</b> </h3>
      
      <p> Like most people, I believe I am special. However, my life tells a completely different story, it’s not only special but extraordinary. It all begins the day my mom decided to send me abroad for education, alone at age 12. </p>
      
      <p> I’m grateful for this life-changing opportunity, from Taiwan Taipei to Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Since I’m 8,000 miles from home, there’s no way of going back, I might as well live a life I’m not going to forget. 
        I was shy and kept to myself at first, finding myself lonely, with no friends and family, speaking no English, and making no progress. But I realized that’s not the life I want; I want to try the best pretzel and cheesesteak, I want to see the cracked liberty bell and run up the Rocky steps; I learned to spend adventure with myself or I'll be missing out. 
        When I turned 13, I met my church friends who helped me turn a switch on in myself that allowed me to open up and start my adventures. I started to participate and sync with the world around me. The change in myself is unbelievable. 
        One of my all-time favorite memories is walking an hour both ways to school in 8th grade. It was a private school without a school bus. Despite the weather condition, it has never stopped me on my adventure. </p>
      
       <p> I threw a stone on the frozen Delaware River, heard the voice of a rusty minecart pass by. I have been honked at by the aggressive driver every morning, and bought my first ice cream cone from a truck. Asked and learned how to distinguish coins by a cashier lady; I stood under the first ray of the morning dawn on the first day of spring and crossed the busiest highway in  Philadelphia on foot. 
        I’ve experienced the sweet taste of life, feeling so alive like I never had before. Without this experience which many people consider a hard course, I wouldn’t be as desperate to know the adventure that’s waiting for me. No matter if it's good or bad, I can’t wait for the new factor in my life. With this experience, I learned to not be afraid to be different, to throw myself out there in order to become the person I dream to be.</p>
      
      <p> I know there are people who are smarter than me, but I have never held back a second to do my best in every little thing. I crave learning new things, I’m not afraid to try even if it may be some embarrassing memories. Thus, I think failure fears me more than I fear him. 
        By being away from family, I consider these are things I need to have, and I call this “growing up”. It teaches me to hold an optimistic attitude towards challenges and a grateful heart for the hands that held me up. By stepping into the new chapter of my life, I hold the experience from the past, hope for the future, and a smile for the challenges. I am ready to make myself proud and strive to be who I wanted to be.</p>
